.SH NAME
scanpartitions \- fstab helper script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBscanpartitions\fR [\-l|\-\-labels] [\-u|\-\-uuids] [devices]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Parses /proc/partitions and generates a device name, mount point
and filesystem type suitable for use in /etc/fstab for each valid
partition. vol_id is used to gather information about the volume
label and filesystem uuid/type for each partition.
.PP
Using UUID or LABEL disk identification in /etc/fstab is more robust
than using the device name; adding or removing a system disk changes
disk device names but not the filesystem uuid or volume label.
.PP
LABEL is given priority over UUID when the labels=1 and uuids=1
options are used together.
.PP
Linux non-native filesystems (eg. ntfs, vfat, hfsplus) may not be
able to make use of the LABEL or UUID volume identifiers. These
filesystems can use the corresponding /dev/disk/by-label/ or
/dev/disk/by-uuid/ device nodes when existing, otherwise fall back
to the base device node (eg /dev/hda1) and not benefit from the
advantages described above.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-l|--labels\fR
Enable the use of the volume LABEL identifier.
.TP
\fB\-u|--uuids\fR
Enable the use of the filesystem UUID identifier.
.PP
.SH USAGE
\fBscanpartitions\fR will parse \fI/proc/partitions\fR if no block
device names are given as arguments.
.PP
The following example will print a line for all supported volumes
contained in \fI/proc/partitions\fR, using UUID metainfo for volume
name:
.PP
.RS
\fBscanpartitions --uuids\fR
.RE
.PP
The following example with print a line for block devices /dev/sda1
and /dev/sda2, using LABEL metainfo where possible:
.PP
.RS
\fBscanpartitions -l /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2\fR
